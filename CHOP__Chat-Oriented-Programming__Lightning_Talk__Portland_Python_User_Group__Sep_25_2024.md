# Purpose of talk
Briefly describe CHOP
Discussion: your use of CHOP (or Gen AI for coding in general)

# What is CHOP?

### CHOP definition
CHOP, noun: coding via iterative prompt refinement
Use a generative AI chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT) to do the **bulk of coding and testing** via ongoing dialogue with the chatbot using **iterative refinement**.

### CHOP Timeline
- "CHOP": coined in blog post [The Death of the Junior Developer](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer)  by Steve Yegge from Sourcegraph, Jun 24, 2024
- 2024 milestone: GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 / ... -- tipping point that enabled CHOP

### What CHOP is **not**:  
o code completions / auto-suggestions  (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding assistant feature)
o using chat when stuck

### Misc
- If you give up doing CHOP and go to Google or Stack Overflow to solve your problem, you've failed and didn't use CHOP effectively.
- Sourcegraph Cody: has an excellent free plan
