# Purpose of talk
## • Briefly describe CHOP
## • Discussion: your experiences using CHOP (or Gen AI for coding in general)

# What CHOP is
## • CHOP, noun: coding via iterative prompt refinement
## • Use a generative AI chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT) to do the **bulk of coding and testing** via ongoing dialogue with the chatbot using **iterative refinement**.
## • If you give up doing CHOP and go to Google or Stack Overflow to solve your problem, you've failed and didn't use CHOP effectively.  The problem isn't the LLM, it's you.

# What CHOP is **not**:  
## • code completions / auto-suggestions  (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding assistant feature)
## • using chat when stuck

# CHOP Timeline
## • "CHOP": coined in blog post [The Death of the Junior Developer](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer)  by Steve Yegge from Sourcegraph, Jun 24, 2024
## • 2024 milestone: GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 / ... -- tipping point that enabled CHOP

# My Experience
## • unit tests: fantastic
## • coding: sometimes great (e.g., create a class to ...)
## • iterations: haven't been patient enough
## • eager to learn more how others use it (particularly, upcoming video with Yegge & Kim)

# Discussion
## • Have you heard of CHOP or the blog post?
## • Have you done CHOP?
## • How do you use Gen AI for coding?
